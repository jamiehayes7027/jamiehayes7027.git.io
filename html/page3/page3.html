			<h1>Project Idea: Ready,Set,Relax</h1>
			<p>
				After doing some research and after playing PC games for some many years now I have always felt like there are not enough “satisfying” or “relaxing”
				games on the market. Most games are high stress or require a lot of mental commitment in order to play preventing you from really relaxing when you
				are in the mood for some dopamine release. Some games on the market don’t even guarantee a fun experience as you could spend hours playing games such
				as World of Warcraft and League of Legends and finish your session and not even feel satisfied. I have come up with the Project idea of creating a
				Parkour/wall climbing free running procedural game in the Unity game designer. I have decided to name this project Ready, Set, Relax <br><br>

The reason why I chose Unity is the ease of use and the support that the Unity community can offer. I am no expert on Unity but the small amount of time I
have spent in the program has been rewarding and fairly easy to pick up and learn. It also has one of the best physics engines I have seen which makes it
perfect for my parkour wall running game. I play a lot of PC games in my spare time. Most of the games I play all have pros and cons but sometimes I feel
often I have to dump a lot of my time into a game to get anywhere, specially how most games now days are either free to play with microtransactions or require
to keep playing for hours just to move forward in the game a small percentage. I want to make a game that will give you freedom, will give you that “feel good”
feeling. Also, I would like to make it multiplayer and integrate the Unity’s physics engine into the game. I have decided that it won’t have any story background
or lore but it will be a game that you can just jump and play with your friends have some fun, then move onto your more mentally demanding games.<br><br></p>
<p>
The game will include features such as

<ul>
<li>Possible console support </li>
<li>Console controller support </li>
<li>Community modding support </li>
<li>Computer generated levels </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The main make up of the game would be you spawn in as a 3rd person camera, free runner and there would be no floor, set on a bunch of platforms that either
float In the sky ahead of the player or are attached to the side of walls running vertically across the game. The goal is there is no goal. I aim to make a
game that just makes you feel satisfied. To do this I could add advanced features such as wall running, speed boosts when you go into a crouch slide,
unlockable skins for your character (free), unlockable skybox themes or running boots smoke effects added to your characters shoes. I will also add a point
system where you gain points from keeping up your speed, breaking your max speed record and also add a trick system. I think this will make the game very
satisfying for those times where you want something fast and fun to either refocus or just relax a little. That is my main goal with the Unity project. To
make a game that will relax players and also have modding community support if the community whishes to mod the game as Unity supports modding and all you
need is a good understanding of the C# programming language.<br><br>

I have decided that the game will be procedural or computer generated. In other words, an endlessly generated level design in the same design as a world popular
game Minecraft. There are some considerable negatives of making a game procedural such as there is no “endgame” or “max level” which some players may find
undesirable but I could add features such as, a in game Kilometer or mile tracker that tracks how far you have free run through out the game. Also add systems
that reward players for reaching certain milestones such as air time, wall running time, certain number of tricks completed and implement the previously mentioned
rewards of cosmetics for these feats of strength within the game itself.  The game will optimistically be hosted on Steam as a product costing a one-time
purchase of 10$ as I think a game of this effort and simplistic approach is worth that amount.  I also wish to make the game playable on all most modern-day
systems as now days I have personally noticed most games are so overly complicated and buggy that it makes it frustrating to play which I am trying to avoid
in this game. I want the players to relax and have a fun time in game that they can just launch, it runs, hit a few milestones and close.<br><br>

I will be using the Unity engine https://unity.com/
This engine is used in the development of many video games on the market such as
-Rust
-Ori and the blind Forest
A good knowledge in the C# programming language would be desirable, something I currently do not have but I am researching and playing
around with at the current moment.  Unity uses scripts coded in C# to determine a vast diversity of variables and uses logic to come to effects
inside the game, which you can add to objects, environment and everything in the engine that can be made. Also having a PC that can keep up with
the demands of the engine as you have to play test constant as you create new things in the engine, compiling script codes repeatable can be costly
on a computer’s hardware. Luckily my own personal computer has enough fire power for this task but let’s say for an example if a developer team was hired,
they would need access to tools with the necessary power to complete the development of the game, as not having the necessary power would hinder the speed at
which the game is developed and end in loss of profit. Unity itself requires a subscription to use the program which can also be a con of the engine itself.
I have also considered adding multiplayer to the game itself. I know from researching that adding multiplayer to a unity game requires a lot of advanced coding,
and compatibility issues start to arises. Because the game itself is a non-competitive game I am confident leaving the game Client side as well as this will make
modding the game easier for the community. The server would have to fetch the joining players “mod list” and adapt it to the player who does not have the mods so
that it would stop bugs and glitches from occurring due to players not having the same client-side version as each other. I my self are not to familiar with how
all this works. But I plan to learn more through completing an Introduction to Programming and through completing a Bachelor in Information Technology. From which
I wish to learn more about the different programming languages.
If this project is successful, I would have made a game that will be praised and well know for its relaxing game play, enjoyable scenery and ease of use. People
would have a cheap, easy to install and run game that they could play for half an hour or so and feel refreshed and rewarded for their play time, which was my
original problem with most games. They don’t reward us enough for our dedicated time in my opinion. If I could make a game like this and sell it to the public,
I feel like I would be solving that problem that no only myself, but many gamers have. Why play a game for 4 hours at a time just to be left feeling unsatisfied
or even feeling let down or “ripped off”. </p>
