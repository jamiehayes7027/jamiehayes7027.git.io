<p><u>Results of Online Learning Style Test.</u><p>
<p><small><small><a href="..\..\images/educationplanner.PNG">Right Click Here for Results (open in another tab)</a><small><small></p>

<p> I took this Online Learning Style Test on <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml"
	>educationplanner.org</a>.<br> It has deemed me as an Auditory learner, which I completely agree with.
	I believe I have always found it easier to learn while the subjects are read out to me out loud. Although I can still learn by reading, watching
	etc. I found I do often read out to myself under my breath. In my view these results to me mean that when I am in a team environment, I would
	rather have instructions or demands vocalized to me rather than written down somewhere. I would rather have people discuss with me what the
	plans of the job/project are then have them hand around notes on what we must do to complete the job/project at hand. It might make it
	difficult for other people who don’t learn this way but I believe all learning styles should be included and a team should adapt to the
	learning styles of each other. For instance, if information is being shared within a team, have it distributed in a way in which all learning
	styles can relate with, examples like notes, PowerPoints and verbally. This way everyone has an equal chance of understanding the information
	and can study it in their own learning style.  </p>

<p> The Online Test of My Choice was on <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test">truity.com</a>.<br> I answered the test as
	honestly as I could and I found that I do agree with the results it gave me. I do have many of the traits that the results describe such as
	willingness to help others, a high level of self-discipline, I do make friends easily and find it easy to work in a group. Also, the high
	percentage in the Agreeable section. I find myself in work and out of work that I put myself before others, I tend to rather cooperate with
	other people than “compete”, as the results say, I believe that I am also a forgiving person as well. Even though I had a high score in
	“Neuroticism”, I believe that is true. Like anyone else I am human and when I cause or make mistakes, I hold my self accountable and feel
	like I have let myself down. But I already knew I had this personality trait and I see it as a positive. I have the ability to move on
	from the past and have learnt to learn from my mistakes. Which I think is a very powerful thing to be conscious about as it can/has had
	major positive effects in my work and personal life. In a team environment these results would mean I would always lend a helping hand
	 to my team mates, help them share the load of the work or instruction, take responsibility for my mishaps or issues and I would vocally
	 address my problems and praise for the team. I think when you first meet a team that you have been assigned to, having every person
	 do one of these personality tests and the share it with the group (if they choose to), would be a good idea as it gives people a sense
	 of trust and belonging, which sometimes at the beginning of teamwork can be low as you may not know everyone you are working with and
	 it is an easy and quick way of “breaking the ice”.
