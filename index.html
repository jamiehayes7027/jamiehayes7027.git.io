</p>
<p><b>Interest In IT</b></p>
<p>My initial interests in Information Technology sparked when I was in Computer Science in year 10 at my high school. My teacher was previously a software engineer/IT manager for most of his life before he became a teacher and taught Computer Science. It was my most favorite class at school as he would not hold back. He would teach us about issues as Network Security, Server Setups, the importance of Server Backup and how hardware worked right down to the finest details.  I was really interested as at home I had my own computer and my friends where all into computers and servers. We made our first Minecraft server when I was 16 which at the time, we thought was amazing. It was hosted on my friend’s PC that he made specifically for the server. When I was in year 11-12, I did work experience at a fairly large company in the IT department helping the server admin and his assistant with help desk, server back up and account creation. I found it so exciting as it was where I felt like I belonged. Helping an employee with a problem with their account or helping the IT manager fix a broken printer or repair windows on a laptop, made me feel like I was a part of something big and the backbone of a company’s IT solutions.<br><br> 

I chose to come to RMIT after I left the telecommunications Industry of 8 years. I needed a career change and I thought back on how I loved IT so much when I was younger and felt like it was something I wanted to do as a career and in my future. I looked up reviews and decided to enroll with RMIT. I have loved the staff so far and the online setup is perfect. I am currently enrolled in online studies and also enrolled in Introduction to Programming which am I also excited to pursue. I plan to enroll in the Bachelor of Information Technology in the near future after completing both Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction To Programming.<br><br>

I have learnt a lot so far, Such as designing this website, how to work as a team, how to talk and present information professionally in a work environment. I expect to learn more as time progresses and we learn more about the world of IT and what it does for us. I am extremely excited to learn about Artificial intelligence and the impacts both positive and negative it can and will have on our world, as it is a topic, I have had some interest in for a while now.<br><br>
